Decided to upgrade my gulp generated static website to a jekyll generated blog-aware static website.

I'm really not sure if I'll utilize the blog, since I've done so well with keeping up with blogs in the past. Mostly I've been itching to play with jekyll for a while and my existing site seemed like a pretty straight-forward port.

I've been hosting my site on github pages for well over a year and while it's nothing elaborate, I realized I don't like sinking a lot of time into my website anyhow... Well, apart from this being the ninth iteration of my site since I started it back in 2008.

Here's to the future.
