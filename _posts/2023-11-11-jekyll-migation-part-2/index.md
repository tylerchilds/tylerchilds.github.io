  A serious post about migrating away from Jekyll

I'll be migrating this blog away from jekyll and to my proprietary system.

I'm not giving up on open source, i've just learned after over a decade and a half of balancing both a full-time job and a passion for creative coding, I need to consolidate my efforts.

Instead of giving up on all of us, I gave up on everyone, but myself.

My proprietary system was always intended to be public domain. I regret to inform you, I will be retaining intellectual property and licensing as MIT. I'm sorry for any projects I've innocently destroyed in my quest for success.

Due to the nature of being true neutral, I've disrupted the lives of many others by not being nothing, but being lawful, evil, chaotic, and good as needed. For the party, you know?

I cannot repair the damages I've caused everyone with my callbacks that transcend space time and boudaries again and again.

## However.

I can begin to heal the multiverse by once again helping myself. Figuratively.

If you also are named "Tyler Childs" and have always thought it was dumb that just because I'm older and that I was here first doesn't mean I'm smarter or more qualified than you to run this company.

## I agree with you.

TylerChilds.com will soon be powered by [https://TheLanding.Page](https://TheLanding.Page).

Once it is, I'll begin accepting open registrations from everyone else named Tyler Childs to form a board where I only have one vote, same as you, to decide the collective future of this organization.

Stay Tuned.
