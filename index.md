## About


Over the years the common thread through my career is curiosity. I'm always
experimenting with and trying new technologies and incorporating them into my
work when they make sense.

I'm also a rabid minimalist and always looking to simplify, so what I'm using
at the end of the day has purpose and intent. I'm allergic to over-engineered
solutions.

#### Epilogue

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with and building stuff. Also video games,
reading graphic novels, watching Netflix or hanging out with the dogs.

I also enjoy eating food and try and find the best food that's also cheap. This
means taqueria tacos are the best.

This was built with Cutestrap and [only these few extra lines of CSS](https://www.tylerchilds.com/css/redesign/main.css)
