    		<h2>Resume</h2>
    		<p>Slightly unconventional, but I never wanted to be an oven anyhow.</p>

    	</div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>

<p>To create and contribute more than I consume. To leave the world in a better place than I found it.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>To control a population, simply take away their freedom. The two simplest ways to do that are to make people stupid or poor; it’s even more optimal to achieve both.</p>

<p>It’s wrong to assume that by going into debt to pay for an education that you will one day be able to “get a real job” and be able to pay it back to regain your freedom from debt. However, this is not an excuse to not become educated.</p>

<p>I want to live in a world where education is valued, not as a commodity, but as a right.</p>

<p>The internet is a vast resource of knowledge of every area, where you can pick what you want to learn and the medium in which you’d prefer to learn about it. There are tons of free resources and people willing to teach.</p>

<p>In a digital age, it’s no longer dress for the job you want, not the one you have. It’s learn for the job you want. No matter what you’re doing currently, always set aside time to learn.</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>Some people get dealt a better hand, while others play a terrible hand really well. Nobody else actually wanted to play.</p>

<p>It’s almost overwhelming that our life is compared to a game. In games, not everyone wins, there has to be more to life, such that, the people on top don’t need to enslave the people on the bottom.</p>

<p>I want to live in a world where we work together. A world where we bind ourselves together on our similarities, rather than divide ourselves on our differences.</p>

<h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>

<p>Nothing worthy of note. However, <a href="http://www.github.com/tylerchilds">this is my github</a>.</p>

<h4 id="skills">Skills</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Web Development: <em>Full-stack: Ruby on Rails, CSS specialization</em></li>
  <li>Ranting and conspiracy: <em>Maybe the worlds not as bad as I think and there are just *a lot* of incompetent people in power.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="aspirations">Aspirations</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Watercolor painting</li>
  <li>Home automation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bloopers">Bloopers</h4>

<p>The most powerful weapon we have is our minds.</p>

<p>The most anyone needs to know about history is in your shower, <em>hopefully</em>. Go look at the back of your shampoo. If you’re lazy, here it is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lather</li>
  <li>Rinse</li>
  <li>Repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to rule the world, burn the books. If you can’t burn the books, kill the language.</p>
