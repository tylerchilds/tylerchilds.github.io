## You can call me TyChi

Hey there!

If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by. Back when I first started using the internet, this is when I'd tell you to sign my guestbook. In college, I needed an art credit, so I took a class on video blogging; if I followed that path, I'd command you to like and subscribe to my channel.

But it's 2020 now and I'd like you to subscribe via RSS, if you're open to follow me. I think we need to go back to the future because somewhere after MySpace and before Cambridge Analytica we ended up diverging into the timeline where Biff stole the Grays Sports Almanac.

### Who am I?

Born and rasied on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, I grew an appreciation for the simple things in life early on, sand in my shoes and all that jazz. I've been gone from that life almost a decade doing a stint in Virginia for a few years and currently residing in sunny California.

In my spare time, I'd like to pretend I do a lot of things because I aspire to do a lot of things, but I don't. So realistically, you can catch me playing video games or writing blog posts and making content on the side.

I'm a die-hard supporter of free, open-source software and believe in the spirit of the open web, which is to share information freely and openly. However, that ideology doesn't pay the bills so I'm currently working for The Man&trade;, but guided by ethics. So you won't catch me working on weapon systems, advertising, or any system that codifies systemic biases into software.

Instead, I prefer to focus my professional efforts into building stellar user experiences. On the side, I'm trying to help anyone level up in this area that wants to improve and grow with articles and examples.
