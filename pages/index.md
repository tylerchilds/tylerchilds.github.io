## About

With over a decade of experience in web design and development, Tyler has borne witness to the rise and fall of various tools and technologies. Through the years, he’s discovered the one thing to survive the erosion of time: Simplicity. Using this as his guiding light, he cuts straight to the heart of problems and shares his findings freely and openly. Currently, he spends too much time with Netflix, either watching it or at the office. If he sounds familiar, it’s probably because of Cutestrap or the famous musician with a similar name.
