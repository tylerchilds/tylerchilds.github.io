### Objective

To create and contribute more than I consume. To leave the world in a better place than I found it.

### Education

To control a population, simply take away their freedom. The two simplest ways to do that are to make people stupid or poor; it's even more optimal to achieve both.

It's wrong to assume that by going into debt to pay for an education that you will one day be able to "get a real job" and be able to pay it back to regain your freedom from debt. However, this is not an excuse to not become educated.

I want to live in a world where education is valued, not as a commodity, but as a right.

The internet is a vast resource of knowledge of every area, where you can pick what you want to learn and the medium in which you'd prefer to learn about it. There are tons of free resources and people willing to teach.

In a digital age, it's no longer dress for the job you want, not the one you have. It's learn for the job you want. No matter what you're doing currently, always set aside time to learn.

### Experience

Some people get dealt a better hand, while others play a terrible hand really well. Nobody else actually wanted to play.

People in power want to stay in power. People on the bottom just want a life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. However, the cost of life is so high that most people are in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, and have no free time to improve their quality of life. The world is exhausted.

I want to live in a world where we work together. A world that doesn't leave anyone behind, by empowering them to help themselves and equipping them with the tools to do so.
